Our competences span the whole software life-cycle, from requirements collection to implementation detail, the full-stack, security, and automation.

## Privacy Conscious Website

You Don't Have To Compromise

If you want to respect privacy without compromising on features and functionality, then our privacy conscious site might be for you.
It is self-contained: it does not use 3rd parties, but does not compromise on other aspects such as analytics.
It is a synthesis of open-source components for privacy and -of course- a site crafted for you.

![]()

What it offers:

- A **self-contained** package down to fonts.
Nothing is fetched from across the Web.
Not video and not fonts.

- **Analytics** that respect privacy but give you insight.

- **Rich media** that does not have to compromise privacy.
Use self-hosted video, rather than a 3rd party, to deliver content.

On the technical side:

- CMS: [Directus](https://directus.io/)
- CI/CD: [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- Analytics: [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Development with a Focus on Security & Integration

Our work is interdisciplinary.
We provide technical guidance _and_ execution, from requirements collection to implementation detail.
Our competences span the full stack and those of security and automation.

Some of the languages we work in:

- Go
- Python
- JavaScript
- [Pharo](https://pharo.org/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

Some of the frameworks we are familiar with:

- React
- Django
- [GToolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/)

We have worked in the [SDN space](/references/wobcom), the realm of [personal data](/references/polypoly), and [logistics](/references/saloodo) to name a few.
See our [references](/references) for more details.

## Open Source

We use Open Source internally at Port Zero and in our work.
It means:

- You have access to all the source code for your solution.
- Collectively we can contribute functionality and features useful for others but not critical to business.
- Both parties have the opportunity to show their work.
