Our competences span the whole software life-cycle, from requirements collection to implementation detail, the full-stack, security, and automation.

## Featured Product - Privacy Conscious Website

### You Don't Have To Compromise

If you want to respect privacy without compromising on features and functionality, then our privacy conscious site might be for you.
It is self-contained: it does not use 3rd parties, but does not compromise on other aspects such as analytics.
It is a synthesis of open-source components for privacy and -of course- a site crafted for you.

Take a look at the [polypoly](https://polypoly.eu/en/home) site:

![https://polypoly.eu/en/home](/img/product/polypoly-privacy-conscious-site.png)

What it offers:

- A **self-contained** package down to fonts.
Nothing is fetched from across the Web.
Not video and not fonts.

- **Analytics** that respect privacy but give you insight.

- **Rich media** that does not have to compromise privacy.
Use self-hosted video, rather than a 3rd party, to deliver content.

On the technical side:

- CMS: [Directus](https://directus.io/)
- CI/CD: [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- Analytics: [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Services - Development with a Focus on Security & Integration

Our work is interdisciplinary.
We provide technical guidance _and_ execution, from requirements collection to implementation detail.
Our competences span the full stack and those of security and automation.

Some of the languages we work in:

- Go
- Python
- JavaScript
- [Pharo](https://pharo.org/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

Some of the frameworks we are familiar with:

- React
- Django
- [GToolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/)

We have worked in the [SDN space](/references/wobcom), the realm of [personal data](/references/polypoly), and [logistics](/references/saloodo) to name a few.
See our [references](/references) for more details.

## Open Source

We use Open Source internally at Port Zero and in our work.
It means:

- You have access to all the source code for your solution.
- Collectively we can contribute functionality and features useful for others but not critical to business.
- Both parties have the opportunity to show their work.
