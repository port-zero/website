We enable our partners to live and practice solid process-oriented Information Security throughout all levels of their organisation. We tackle tricky individual challenges with them, or actively support them as long-term partners with the implementation of processes and frameworks, a milestone of which can be one of the relevant Information Security certifications. We love to play on our unique strength to bring together a diverse team of highly-skilled specialists to ensure deep contribution in all relevant fields. Management frameworks and certifications in which we have particularly solid implementation experience include _ISO 27000+_, _BSI IT-Grundschutz_, _C5_, _TISAX_ and _PCI DSS_.
