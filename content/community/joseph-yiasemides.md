Joseph has experience on the server side (Erlang, Elixir, and Go), exploratory application software with the [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com)/Pharo, and a little JS for the Web.
He has worked with data using the Python ecosystem, taught & spoken about software, and is on the organising committee for [EnthusiastiCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCysZMezyfn6QuDPNlbl6jHQ/playlists) (a conference about enthusiasm and computing).
You can find his [Open Source contributions](http://resume.github.io/?Dzol#contributions) on GitHub and his talks via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiasemides/).
He sees his current role of Software Team Lead as trilateral: What can the Software Team, Port Zero, and our Clients do for each other?
