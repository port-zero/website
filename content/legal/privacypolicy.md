By using our website, you consent to the collection, processing, and usage of data as described below. Our website can be visited without registration. Data accessed on the site on the server are saved as “server log files” without being directly traceable to your person. These data provide useful information for statistics and attack-tracking. The following data are logged:

* Accessed pages and/or names of accessed files
* Date and time
* HTTP browser header

Personal data, with exception of the IP address, specifically name, address and e-mail address shall not be collected.

* The final segment of the IP address will not be collected by us; we can still monitor the IP range of the attacker in case of an external attack without storing your entire IP address.

We will not disclose your data to third parties without your consent.

We reserve the right to subsequently review the server log files if we discover concrete evidence of illegal use.

### Right of Refusal and Information Options

We would like to make clear that you have right of access to your personal data collected by us (in case this statement is insufficient) and can––at any time––obtain the relevant information from us. Unless your request conflicts with a legal obligation to store data (e.g. data retention), you are entitled to the correction of incorrect data and to block or erase your personal data.
