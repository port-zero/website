If you like Pina Coladas, and writing code in the rain
If you´re not into Electron, if you have half a brain
If you like config make install at midnight, insecure software to break,
I´m the job that you´ve looked for, write to me, and escape!

This web page is built by a small team of software engineers and designers in an office full of plants, programmers and possibilities.
